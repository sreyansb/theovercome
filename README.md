# OVERCOME  
[Overcome](https://theovercome.000webhostapp.com/)  
A website developed as our 3rd semester Web Technologies Project.  
This project was developed as a way to talk to people, to relax, to listen and watch a curated list of music,inspiring videos,etc.  
A user can also publish journals, records etc.  
This website was a simple website and doesn't use a lot of secure features.We are trying to work on that :=)  
It was kept in mind to help fight depression.
